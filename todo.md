- [x] fix typo in project-name: `earhquake` -> `earthquake`
- [ ] for `ui` package - can we use NextJS instead of react? and lets add storybook there; also we would be able to import NextJS configs to web app (if we have i18n, or something else) and other configs - like tailwind; also would be able to test in storybook with NextJS Image and Link, etc.
